CHAPTER 2

Q1: What is the primary goal of an operating system (OS)?
A1: The primary goal of an OS is to make the system easy to use by virtualizing resources like the processor, memory, and disk.

Q2: What is the crux of the problem when building an operating system?
A2: The crux of the problem is to determine how the operating system virtualizes resources efficiently and with the necessary hardware support.

Q3: What are some of the important topics that this chapter will cover?
A3: Important topics include virtualization of the CPU and memory, concurrency, and persistence via devices and file systems.

2.1

Q1: What is the process of virtualizing the CPU?
A1: Virtualizing the CPU is the process of creating the illusion of a large number of virtual CPUs from a single CPU or a small set of them, allowing multiple programs to seemingly run simultaneously.

Q2: What is the role of operating system APIs?
A2: Operating system APIs provide interfaces for users to communicate their desires to the OS, such as running, stopping, or managing programs.

Q3: What is the purpose of OS policies?
A3: OS policies are used to answer questions and make decisions related to resource allocation and management, such as which program should run when multiple programs want to run at the same time.

2.2

Q1: What is the purpose of virtualizing memory in an operating system?
A1: The purpose of virtualizing memory is to create the illusion that each running program has its own private memory, while in reality, physical memory is a shared resource managed by the operating system.

Q2: What is a process's virtual address space?
A2: A process's virtual address space, or address space, is its own private memory that the operating system maps onto the physical memory of the machine.

Q3: How does virtualizing memory affect memory references within running programs?
A3: Virtualizing memory ensures that memory references within one running program do not affect the address space of other processes or the operating system itself.

2.3

Q1: What is the main theme of concurrency in operating systems and multi-threaded programs?
A1: Concurrency refers to the problems that arise when working on many things at once within the same program, such as managing multiple processes or threads and ensuring correct execution.

Q2: What is a thread in the context of multi-threaded programs?
A2: A thread is a function running within the same memory space as other functions, with more than one of them active at a time.

Q3: Why do concurrency problems occur when threads share resources like a counter?
A3: Concurrency problems occur because instructions are not executed atomically (all at once), which can lead to unexpected and inconsistent outcomes when multiple threads access shared resources.

2.4

Q1: What is the main theme of persistence in operating systems?
A1: Persistence refers to the ability to store data permanently, even in the face of power loss or system crashes, using hardware and software to manage and store data on I/O devices like hard drives or SSDs.

Q2: What is the role of the file system in the operating system?
A2: The file system is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of files on a disk, ensuring their efficient and reliable storage and enabling sharing of information between different processes.

Q3: What are some techniques used by file systems to ensure data reliability and high performance?
A3: File systems may use techniques such as delayed writes, journaling or copy-on-write, and various data structures and access methods to optimize performance, maintain consistency, and recover from failures.

2.5

Q1: What is the primary goal when designing and implementing an operating system?
A1: The primary goal is to build up abstractions that make the system convenient and easy to use while managing physical resources, virtualization, concurrency, and persistent storage.

Q2: How does an operating system aim to provide high performance?
A2: An operating system aims to provide high performance by minimizing overheads, which can arise in the form of extra time (more instructions) or extra space (in memory or on disk).

Q3: What are some other design goals for an operating system?
A3: Other design goals include providing protection between applications and the OS, ensuring reliability, achieving energy efficiency, enhancing security, and supporting mobility across different devices.

2.6

Q1: What was the primary function of early operating systems?
A1: Early operating systems primarily functioned as a set of libraries for commonly-used functions, such as low-level I/O handling code, to make life easier for developers.

Q2: What is a system call and why was it invented?
A2: A system call is a special hardware instruction and hardware state that allows a controlled process transition into the OS. It was invented to provide a formal, controlled way to access OS routines, ensuring privacy and security.

Q3: What was the major innovation in the era of multiprogramming?
A3: In the era of multiprogramming, operating systems began loading multiple jobs into memory and rapidly switching between them, improving CPU utilization and enabling more efficient use of machine resources.

CHAPTER 4

Q: What is the basic abstraction provided by an OS and how does it create the illusion of many CPUs?
A: The basic abstraction provided by an OS is the process, which is a running program. The OS creates the illusion of many CPUs by virtualizing the CPU through time-sharing, allowing multiple processes to run concurrently by quickly switching between them.

Q: What are the two components needed for implementing CPU virtualization in an OS?
A: The two components needed are mechanisms, which are low-level methods or protocols that implement a needed piece of functionality, and policies, which are algorithms for making decisions within the OS.

Q: What is the primary technique used by an OS to share resources among multiple entities?
A: The primary technique used is time-sharing, which involves allowing a resource to be used for a short period by one entity and then another, enabling many entities to share the resource.

4.1

Q: What is a process in the context of an OS?
A: A process is the abstraction provided by the OS for a running program, encompassing its machine state, including memory, registers, and I/O information.

Q: What are the key components of a process's machine state?
A: The key components of a process's machine state are its address space (memory), registers (including special registers like the program counter, stack pointer, and frame pointer), and I/O information (such as open files).

Q: What is the design paradigm that separates high-level policies from low-level mechanisms in operating systems?
A: The design paradigm is called "separating policy and mechanism," which enables easier changes to policies without rethinking the mechanism, promoting modularity in software design.

4.2

Q: What are the basic components of a Process API in an operating system?
A: The basic components of a Process API include Create, Destroy, Wait, Miscellaneous Control, and Status.

Q: What is the purpose of the Create function in the Process API?
A: The Create function allows the operating system to create new processes, such as when a user types a command into the shell or double-clicks on an application icon.

Q: What are some examples of Miscellaneous Control functions in the Process API?
A: Examples of Miscellaneous Control functions include suspending a process (stopping it from running for a while) and resuming it (continuing its execution).

4.3

Q: What is the first step in transforming a program into a process?
A: The first step in transforming a program into a process is loading the program's code and any static data into memory, in the address space of the process.

Q: What does the OS need to do before running a process, aside from loading code and static data into memory?
A: The OS needs to allocate memory for the program's run-time stack, initialize the stack with arguments, allocate memory for the program's heap, and perform other initialization tasks related to input/output (I/O).

Q: How does the OS start program execution after setting the stage?
A: The OS starts program execution by jumping to the main() routine, transferring control of the CPU to the newly-created process, and thus beginning the program's execution.

4.4

Q: What are the three simplified states a process can be in at a given time?
A: The three simplified states a process can be in are Running, Ready, and Blocked.

Q: What does the Running state mean for a process?
A: In the Running state, a process is executing instructions on a processor.

Q: What does the Blocked state mean for a process?
A: In the Blocked state, a process has performed an operation that makes it not ready to run until some other event takes place, such as waiting for an I/O request to complete.

4.5

Q: What is the main data structure used by the OS to track the state of each process?
A: The main data structure used by the OS to track the state of each process is the Process List, also called the task list.

Q: What is the register context in a process data structure used for?
A: The register context in a process data structure is used to hold the contents of a stopped process's registers. When a process is stopped, its registers are saved to this memory location, allowing the OS to resume running the process by restoring the register values.

Q: What is a Process Control Block (PCB)?
A: A Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure that stores information about a process, also known as a process descriptor. It is used by the OS to keep track of all running programs in the system.
