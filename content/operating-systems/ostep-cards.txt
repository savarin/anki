CHAPTER 2

Q1: What is the primary goal of an operating system (OS)?
A1: The primary goal of an OS is to make the system easy to use by virtualizing resources like the processor, memory, and disk.

Q2: What is the crux of the problem when building an operating system?
A2: The crux of the problem is to determine how the operating system virtualizes resources efficiently and with the necessary hardware support.

Q3: What are some of the important topics that this chapter will cover?
A3: Important topics include virtualization of the CPU and memory, concurrency, and persistence via devices and file systems.

2.1

Q1: What is the process of virtualizing the CPU?
A1: Virtualizing the CPU is the process of creating the illusion of a large number of virtual CPUs from a single CPU or a small set of them, allowing multiple programs to seemingly run simultaneously.

Q2: What is the role of operating system APIs?
A2: Operating system APIs provide interfaces for users to communicate their desires to the OS, such as running, stopping, or managing programs.

Q3: What is the purpose of OS policies?
A3: OS policies are used to answer questions and make decisions related to resource allocation and management, such as which program should run when multiple programs want to run at the same time.

2.2

Q1: What is the purpose of virtualizing memory in an operating system?
A1: The purpose of virtualizing memory is to create the illusion that each running program has its own private memory, while in reality, physical memory is a shared resource managed by the operating system.

Q2: What is a process's virtual address space?
A2: A process's virtual address space, or address space, is its own private memory that the operating system maps onto the physical memory of the machine.

Q3: How does virtualizing memory affect memory references within running programs?
A3: Virtualizing memory ensures that memory references within one running program do not affect the address space of other processes or the operating system itself.

2.3

Q1: What is the main theme of concurrency in operating systems and multi-threaded programs?
A1: Concurrency refers to the problems that arise when working on many things at once within the same program, such as managing multiple processes or threads and ensuring correct execution.

Q2: What is a thread in the context of multi-threaded programs?
A2: A thread is a function running within the same memory space as other functions, with more than one of them active at a time.

Q3: Why do concurrency problems occur when threads share resources like a counter?
A3: Concurrency problems occur because instructions are not executed atomically (all at once), which can lead to unexpected and inconsistent outcomes when multiple threads access shared resources.

2.4

Q1: What is the main theme of persistence in operating systems?
A1: Persistence refers to the ability to store data permanently, even in the face of power loss or system crashes, using hardware and software to manage and store data on I/O devices like hard drives or SSDs.

Q2: What is the role of the file system in the operating system?
A2: The file system is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of files on a disk, ensuring their efficient and reliable storage and enabling sharing of information between different processes.

Q3: What are some techniques used by file systems to ensure data reliability and high performance?
A3: File systems may use techniques such as delayed writes, journaling or copy-on-write, and various data structures and access methods to optimize performance, maintain consistency, and recover from failures.

2.5

Q1: What is the primary goal when designing and implementing an operating system?
A1: The primary goal is to build up abstractions that make the system convenient and easy to use while managing physical resources, virtualization, concurrency, and persistent storage.

Q2: How does an operating system aim to provide high performance?
A2: An operating system aims to provide high performance by minimizing overheads, which can arise in the form of extra time (more instructions) or extra space (in memory or on disk).

Q3: What are some other design goals for an operating system?
A3: Other design goals include providing protection between applications and the OS, ensuring reliability, achieving energy efficiency, enhancing security, and supporting mobility across different devices.

2.6

Q1: What was the primary function of early operating systems?
A1: Early operating systems primarily functioned as a set of libraries for commonly-used functions, such as low-level I/O handling code, to make life easier for developers.

Q2: What is a system call and why was it invented?
A2: A system call is a special hardware instruction and hardware state that allows a controlled process transition into the OS. It was invented to provide a formal, controlled way to access OS routines, ensuring privacy and security.

Q3: What was the major innovation in the era of multiprogramming?
A3: In the era of multiprogramming, operating systems began loading multiple jobs into memory and rapidly switching between them, improving CPU utilization and enabling more efficient use of machine resources.

CHAPTER 4

Q: What is the basic abstraction provided by an OS and how does it create the illusion of many CPUs?
A: The basic abstraction provided by an OS is the process, which is a running program. The OS creates the illusion of many CPUs by virtualizing the CPU through time-sharing, allowing multiple processes to run concurrently by quickly switching between them.

Q: What are the two components needed for implementing CPU virtualization in an OS?
A: The two components needed are mechanisms, which are low-level methods or protocols that implement a needed piece of functionality, and policies, which are algorithms for making decisions within the OS.

Q: What is the primary technique used by an OS to share resources among multiple entities?
A: The primary technique used is time-sharing, which involves allowing a resource to be used for a short period by one entity and then another, enabling many entities to share the resource.

4.1

Q: What is a process in the context of an OS?
A: A process is the abstraction provided by the OS for a running program, encompassing its machine state, including memory, registers, and I/O information.

Q: What are the key components of a process's machine state?
A: The key components of a process's machine state are its address space (memory), registers (including special registers like the program counter, stack pointer, and frame pointer), and I/O information (such as open files).

Q: What is the design paradigm that separates high-level policies from low-level mechanisms in operating systems?
A: The design paradigm is called "separating policy and mechanism," which enables easier changes to policies without rethinking the mechanism, promoting modularity in software design.

4.2

Q: What are the basic components of a Process API in an operating system?
A: The basic components of a Process API include Create, Destroy, Wait, Miscellaneous Control, and Status.

Q: What is the purpose of the Create function in the Process API?
A: The Create function allows the operating system to create new processes, such as when a user types a command into the shell or double-clicks on an application icon.

Q: What are some examples of Miscellaneous Control functions in the Process API?
A: Examples of Miscellaneous Control functions include suspending a process (stopping it from running for a while) and resuming it (continuing its execution).

4.3

Q: What is the first step in transforming a program into a process?
A: The first step in transforming a program into a process is loading the program's code and any static data into memory, in the address space of the process.

Q: What does the OS need to do before running a process, aside from loading code and static data into memory?
A: The OS needs to allocate memory for the program's run-time stack, initialize the stack with arguments, allocate memory for the program's heap, and perform other initialization tasks related to input/output (I/O).

Q: How does the OS start program execution after setting the stage?
A: The OS starts program execution by jumping to the main() routine, transferring control of the CPU to the newly-created process, and thus beginning the program's execution.

4.4

Q: What are the three simplified states a process can be in at a given time?
A: The three simplified states a process can be in are Running, Ready, and Blocked.

Q: What does the Running state mean for a process?
A: In the Running state, a process is executing instructions on a processor.

Q: What does the Blocked state mean for a process?
A: In the Blocked state, a process has performed an operation that makes it not ready to run until some other event takes place, such as waiting for an I/O request to complete.

4.5

Q: What is the main data structure used by the OS to track the state of each process?
A: The main data structure used by the OS to track the state of each process is the Process List, also called the task list.

Q: What is the register context in a process data structure used for?
A: The register context in a process data structure is used to hold the contents of a stopped process's registers. When a process is stopped, its registers are saved to this memory location, allowing the OS to resume running the process by restoring the register values.

Q: What is a Process Control Block (PCB)?
A: A Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure that stores information about a process, also known as a process descriptor. It is used by the OS to keep track of all running programs in the system.

CHAPTER 5

Q: What are the three main UNIX system calls for process creation and control?
A: The three main UNIX system calls for process creation and control are fork(), exec(), and wait().

Q: What is the purpose of the fork() system call in UNIX systems?
A: The fork() system call in UNIX systems is used to create a new process, where the creator is called the parent and the newly created process is called the child. The child process is a nearly identical copy of the parent.

Q: What are the roles of the wait() and exec() system calls in UNIX systems?
A: The wait() system call allows a parent process to wait for its child process to complete execution, while the exec() family of system calls allows a child process to break free from its similarity to its parent and execute an entirely new program.

5.1

Q: What is the purpose of the fork() system call and what is unusual about it?
A: The fork() system call is used to create a new process, with the newly-created process being an (almost) exact copy of the calling process. The unusual aspect is that the child process doesn't start running at main(), but comes into life as if it had called fork() itself.

Q: How does the fork() system call differentiate between parent and child processes in its return value?
A: The fork() system call differentiates between parent and child processes by returning the PID of the newly-created child to the parent process, while returning a value of zero to the child process.

Q: What causes the non-determinism in the output of a program using the fork() system call?
A: The non-determinism in the output of a program using the fork() system call is caused by the CPU scheduler, which determines which process (parent or child) runs at a given moment in time. Since the scheduler is complex, it is difficult to predict which process will run first.

5.2

Q: What is the purpose of the wait() system call?
A: The wait() system call allows a parent process to delay its execution until its child process finishes executing.

Q: How does adding a wait() call make the output of a program with fork() deterministic?
A: By adding a wait() call, the parent process will always wait for the child process to finish executing before it continues, ensuring that the child process always prints its output first, regardless of which process runs first.

Q: What happens when a parent process calls wait() if the child process is still executing?
A: When a parent process calls wait() while the child process is still executing, the parent process will be blocked and not continue its execution until the child process has completed and exited.

5.3

Q: What is the purpose of the exec() system call?
A: The exec() system call is used to run a different program within the current process, replacing the current code segment and static data with those from the new program, and re-initializing the heap, stack, and other parts of the memory space.

Q: How does exec() differ from fork() in terms of process creation?
A: While fork() creates a new process as a nearly identical copy of the parent process, exec() does not create a new process; instead, it transforms the currently running program into a different running program.

Q: What happens to the current program after a successful call to exec()?
A: After a successful call to exec(), the current program is replaced with the new program, and it is as if the original program never ran. A successful call to exec() never returns.

5.4

Q: Why is the separation of fork() and exec() essential in building a UNIX shell?
A: The separation of fork() and exec() allows the shell to run code after the call to fork() but before the call to exec(), enabling it to alter the environment of the about-to-be-run program and implement a variety of interesting features.

Q: How does the shell implement output redirection using fork() and exec()?
A: The shell creates a child process with fork(), and before calling exec(), it closes the standard output and opens the specified output file. As a result, any output from the soon-to-be-running program is sent to the file instead of the screen.

Q: How are UNIX pipes implemented, and what is their purpose?
A: UNIX pipes are implemented using the pipe() system call. They connect the output of one process to an in-kernel pipe (queue) and the input of another process to the same pipe, allowing the output of one process to be seamlessly used as input to the next and enabling long and useful chains of commands to be created.

5.5

Q: What is the purpose of the kill() system call in UNIX systems?
A: The kill() system call is used to send signals to a process, including directives to pause, die, and other useful imperatives.

Q: How is the security and usability of a multi-user system maintained in UNIX systems?
A: UNIX systems have a strong conception of the notion of a user. Users log in with credentials and can only control their own processes, while the operating system parcels out resources (such as CPU, memory, and disk) to each user and their processes to meet overall system goals.

Q: What are man pages and why are they important for systems programmers?
A: Man pages are the original form of documentation on UNIX systems, created before the web existed. Reading man pages is a key step in the growth of a systems programmer, as they contain useful information about system calls, shells, and potential errors or return values.

5.6

Q: What command allows you to see which processes are running in UNIX systems?
A: The "ps" command allows you to see which processes are running in UNIX systems.

Q: What is the purpose of the "top" command in UNIX systems?
A: The "top" command displays the processes of the system and how much CPU and other resources they are consuming.

Q: What is the role of the superuser (root) in UNIX-based systems?
A: In UNIX-based systems, the superuser (root) has special abilities, such as killing arbitrary processes and running powerful commands like shutdown. The superuser can administer the system without the limitations of regular users.
